ðŸ’¡ **Q1.** Given an array of integers nums and an integer target, return indices of the two numbers such that they add up to target.

You may assume that each input would have exactly one solution, and you may not use the same element twice.

You can return the answer in any order.

**Example:**
Input: nums = [2,7,11,15], target = 9
Output0 [0,1]

**Explanation:** Because nums[0] + nums[1] == 9, we return [0, 1][

1.Initialize an empty dictionary (hash map) called complement_dict.
2.Iterate through the array nums using an index i and the corresponding value num.
3.Calculate the complement by subtracting num from the target value: complement = target - num.
4.Check if the complement exists in the complement_dict by using the in operator: if complement in complement_dict:.
5.If the complement exists, it means we have found the two numbers that add up to the target. In this case, we return the indices of the complement and the current number by accessing their values in the complement_dict: [complement_dict[complement], i].
6.If the complement doesn't exist in the complement_dict, we add the current number num as a key in the complement_dict, with its corresponding index i as the value: complement_dict[num] = i.
7.If no solution is found after iterating through the entire array, we return an empty list [].

ðŸ’¡ **Q2.** Given an integer array nums and an integer val, remove all occurrences of val in nums in-place. The order of the elements may be changed. Then return the number of elements in nums which are not equal to val.

Consider the number of elements in nums which are not equal to val be k, to get accepted, you need to do the following things:

- Change the array nums such that the first k elements of nums contain the elements which are not equal to val. The remaining elements of nums are not important as well as the size of nums.
- Return k.

**Example :**
Input: nums = [3,2,2,3], val = 3
Output: 2, nums = [2,2,_*,_*]

**Explanation:** Your function should return k = 2, with the first two elements of nums being 2. It does not matter what you leave beyond the returned k (hence they are underscores)[

ðŸ’¡ **Q5.** You are given two integer arrays nums1 and nums2, sorted in non-decreasing order, and two integers m and n, representing the number of elements in nums1 and nums2 respectively.

Merge nums1 and nums2 into a single array sorted in non-decreasing order.

The final sorted array should not be returned by the function, but instead be stored inside the array nums1.
